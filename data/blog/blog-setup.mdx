I wrote [my first blog](https://kaminarios.github.io) 3 years ago, before ChatGPT's first release on November 30, 2022. When I open it today, I still smile. It is a mess but funny. 

It was my first practical frontend project. I was a newbie in JavaScript(still are?), just left my engineering job(not Software engineering), at home waiting to come to US for graduate school. Back then I was looking at all 3 major Js frameworks: React, Vue and Angular. I searched about their strengths and weaknesses. Many online comments on zhihu.com roasted React. Angular was a dying dinosaur. Vue looked promising and simple. Somehow I heard about Svelte, a brand new framework that had the best performance and html-like syntax.

I always eagered to try something new and cool so I decided to build my first blog in Svelte. It took me about 1 month to build it but I only wrote one post ever: https://kaminarios.github.io/posts/first-blog. I recalled I spent most of my time debugging CSS to make it fully responsive. 

Even from today's view, my first blog is feature-rich and fancy--in fact, too fancy with all those animations and transitions. However, I was wrong. Svelte, the next-gen framework is still a niche after 3 years while React dominates the job market, even though it is significantly faster and smaller. Vue is mostly popular in Asia especially China. Ironically I did my first US internship with Angular. In fact, at the core of all these framework they are the same: components, reactive rendering, state management and routing. In the AI era, we should just use the one framework with the most training data.

I only wrote one blog post in the last three years, because Github README and pages are good enough for documenting things. Still, blogging has its value.

Thanks for your reading. Next I will write more posts and make this blog fancier.
